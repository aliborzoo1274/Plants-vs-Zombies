### Core Components

- **Game Engine**:  Main game loop and state management
- **Board**: Game grid and tile management
- **Handler**: Event handling and game logic coordination
- **Entities**: Plants, zombies, projectiles, and sun objects
- **Settings**: Game configuration and parameters
- **Score**: Score tracking system

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler with C++20 support (g++)
- SFML library (included in `files/` directory)
- Make build tool

### Building the Game

```bash
# Compile the project
make

# Run the game
./pvz.out
```

### Cleaning Build Files

```bash
make clean
```

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Collect sun to gain resources
2. Plant sunflowers to generate more sun
3. Use offensive plants (Peashooters) to defend against zombies
4. Use Wall-nuts to protect your other plants
5. Survive zombie waves and protect your lawn!

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project follows object-oriented programming principles with: 

- **Inheritance hierarchy**: Base `Plant` class with specialized plant types
- **Polymorphism**: Different plant and zombie behaviors
- **Encapsulation**:  Separate header and implementation files
- **Component-based design**:  Modular game entities (Board, Handler, Score, etc.)
